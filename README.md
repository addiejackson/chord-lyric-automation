# Chord Lyric Automation
## Purpose
Making chord/lyric sheets can be a pain - it's a combination of spaces and tabs, and it can be impossible to standardize. Additionally, it's a manual process to transpose up or down, or between sharp and flat notation. Enter **Bowstring**. 

It's a lightweight app designed to make it easy to enter lyrics, populate chords, and edit from there. The chordsheet can be copied to the processor of choice, and, if in monospace, the chords will be lined up just as shown on the online Heroku-hosted version. I hope you enjoy!
